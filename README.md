BuyVMServerInterface
============

A Java GUI program for checking status of and issuing shutdown/boot/reboot commands to a BuyVM VPS
The Reboot function is currently disabled (Does not operate as intended. A workaround is to issue a shutdown command then a boot command).
You must set a key & hash before the other buttons on the interface will become enabled
There is a 30 second wait after performing an operation to prevent abuse (this is why the buttons are greyed out after clicking one)
